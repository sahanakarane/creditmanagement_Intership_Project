# creditmanagement website task of Sparks Foundation Internship

As part of my learning internship program at Sparks Foundation, I developed a web-based credit management system that stores credit information in a database. I implemented SQL queries to retrieve and update data and created a user registration and login system to ensure secure access to credit information.
